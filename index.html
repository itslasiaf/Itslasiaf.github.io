        <h2> Anatomy </h2>
        <p>
            The anatomy of a car consists of 4 main parts:
        </p>
         <ul>
                <li>Engine</li>
                <li>Transmission</li>
                <li>Electrics</li>
                <li>Wheel components</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Engine </h3>
        <p>
            Your car's engine is its heart. It is a sophisticated device designed to transform the heat from burning gas into the force that rotates the vehicle's wheels.

        <h3> Transmission </h3>
        <p>
            A car transmission is one of the most important components of a vehicle. It’s what moves the power from the engine to the wheels.

        <h3> Electrics </h3>
        <p>
            Your car’s electrical system consists of the battery, starter and alternator. The battery provides juice to the starter. Then, the alternator gives that battery the energy it needs to power your car.

        <h3> Brakes and suspension </h3>
        <p>
            The brakes work with the steering and suspension to keep you safe on the road and to keep the other drivers safe with whom you share the road. If your suspension is off, your car will nosedive when you step on the brakes, which could cause damage to your car.
