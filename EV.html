        <h1> EV Vehicle </h1>
        <p>
            Electric vehicles (EVs) have a battery instead of a gasoline tank, and an electric motor instead of an internal combustion engine, they provide the same purpose as a regular car and in most cases outpreform them.
        </p>
        <h2> Anatomy </h2>
        <p>
            The anatomy of an EV consists of 3 main parts different from a <a href="./index.html">gas vehicle</a>:
        </p>
         <ul>
                <li>EVB</li>
                <li>Converter</li>
                <li>Motor</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>EVB</h3>
        <p>
            An electric vehicle battery is a rechargeable battery used to power the electric motors of an electric vehicle.

        <h3>Converter</h3>
        <p>
            A converter converts higher-voltage DC power from the battery pack to the lower-voltage DC power needed to run the vehicle.

        <h3>Motor</h3>
        <p>
            Using power from the battery pack the motor drives the vehicle's wheels.
